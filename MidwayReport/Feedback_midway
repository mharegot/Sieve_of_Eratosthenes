Talk feedback for Group 4. Kevin, Mickey, Rick 

Two parts to this feedback on your midway project report:

  A. anonymized feedback from your classmate
  B. my feedback with more verbose comments about parts
     of your presentation

---------------------------------------------------------
 A. feedback from your classmates about your presentation
---------------------------------------------------------

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   The explanation for the reason for balanced pthreads was clear and well explained.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   A bit more explanation of the type of experiments you plan to run, the more
   specific questions you're trying to answer, could be good.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	- images helps in understanding
	- great talking about what you've done 
	  and the different methods

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	- choose a different slide theme... the 
	  rectangle on the right covered writing 
	  and images, at least when presenting
	- intro could be a little longer. I understood
	  the gist of the algorithm, but I wish it was 
	  explained a little more depth

 1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well

       Clear presentation of the background, key ideas, progress, and
       difficulties. Good use of figures.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

      The concepts of static and dynamic scheduling was somewhat hard to follow
      as I am not too familiar with the content.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	I like how they addressed the problem of the Sieve of Eratosthenes
	through a couple of different methods of parallelization. They did 
	a great job of explaining the load balancing issue. 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	Maybe more about results and why they may see differences between
	the parallelization methods (I know they aren't fully done with
	implementation either).

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	Really liked the variety of implementations for solving the prime problem
	Lots of good implementation progress so far and discussed the takeaways well

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	Can talk about tradeoffs/evaluations of diff systems (openmp, cuda) on this problem

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	> The structure of the presentation was clear and helpful 
	for understanding what you are doing.
	> The parts were split well (evenly) between the different 
	group members - same with answering of the questions.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	> I’m not sure if this is just how the slides were shared on
	Zoom but all the slides looked like they were cut so we 
	couldn’t see see all of the diagrams.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  The explanations on
   balanced threads and dynamic balancing were very clear and useful. Answers
   in the question section also clear up confusion about how this algorithm
   (which seems very interesting) and how parallelization works. 

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve I found the
   presentation hard to follow at the beginning. The algorithm makes sense but
   is still an unfamiliar concept, so I'd appreciate if you guys spent a bit
   more time easing us into your topic.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
	Really good use of images and gifs to help illustrate concepts

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
	Results format could be better - difficult to read command line results,
	putting them in a table (or maybe graph) with higher contrast and a 
	clearer dilineation of important vs extraneous information would be better

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   I thought that the animation for the Sieve was a good explanation of how the
   algorithm worked. I also really appreciated the openMP section mentioning how
   scheduling works.

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

   I would have appreciated some more description on how the parallelized
   implementation worked. It was unclear how the sieve was shared between
   threads and how the workload was distributed.

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
-nice overview of the problem and why it is relevant

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
-I would like to know more about the openMP implementation or even just about
the specifics of your algorithm

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
I appreciated the breakdown of the different methods for implementing the algorithm

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
I felt like there were too many implementation details, making the broad
strokes of the techniques hard to follow

---

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

	Interesting topic and engaging slides.			

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

	Better explanation of the sieve of Eratosthenes in the beginning.

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  
       - Nice presentation of the algorithm! I really enjoyed the 
	 infographic. 

       - Nice outlining of the various problems you faced and how 
	 you solved them. Overall, the progression within the 
	 prentation was really clear!

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve
       - I think there could be a bit more slides explaining about
	 the ideas/challenges behind the other implementations?

--------------------------------------------------------------
 B. my feedback on your presentation
--------------------------------------------------------------

* algorithm for finding prime numbers
  * good intro
* sieve of eratosthenes example
  * nice example illustrated with figure (slow down a bit and refer
    to figure as you explain)

* methods of implementation
  * slide good but slow down a bit to explain these a bit more 
  * show the pseudo code for the sequentail algorithm
  * explain how/what is parallelized in each on slides and
    talk through (like Kevin added about balanced pthreads)

* openMP
  add pseudo code to this (this is also sequential)
  it is hard to understand what for loops are you are talking about here
  the static and dynamic figure is nice, but hard to understand what
  threads are doing

* nice results!

   1.  What was at least one thing that the group did well  

   * slide org good, logical order
   * good job answering Qs
   * nice figures 
   * it is clear that you know a lot about this

   2. At least one thing on which the group could improve

    * this was presented much too fast, slow down (you had a lot of time left)
    * add more explaination and details about the algorithms
    * be more clear about what and how parallelized in each approach
      (for final presentation have a slide or two explaining each approach,
       with a figure or example)
    * show psudo code
