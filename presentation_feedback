Part A. Feedback from classmates
=================================
 
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 

* at least one thing did well:

  - Really nice organization in presentation!

  - Super cool that you have four different implementations!



* at least one thing to improve:

  - I think at some point the gif of the Seive algorithm became 

    a bit too redundant and a bit distracting, especially because

    it appears in a number of slides.

Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 


* at least one thing did well: Great introduction and very clear 

verbal presentation!



* at least one thing to improve: My internet was not working well 

for some of the presentation so this might be something that was 

Addressed, but I'm not completely sure what it means to "widen the

sieve." Besides that, from what I was able to see of the 

presentation, it was a great job overall!

Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well: I really liked how concrete your project

	was and how you could very "easily" test your implementations.

	I mean that in terms of the fact that you could visualize the

	results and compare them in a comprehensible way.



* at least one thing to improve:

	A little more on the results slides as a summary would be nice

	see alongside your speaking points. Just makes it easier to absorb

	consolidated information.

Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:



It was cool to see that you tried multiple different kinds of implementations.

Slides are very nice and clean. Analysis specific to CUDA was really good.



* at least one thing to improve:



Some even bigger runs would have been cool to see, but I understand the 

limiations.

Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:

	-good pacing of speed

	-clear explanations, easy to understand/follow

	-very clear how parallelization is used to help 



* at least one thing to improve:

	-I'm personally interested in more investigations of why CUDA performance isn't as good compared to others





--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:

Good explanation of how the algorithm works in series and in parallel



* at least one thing to improve:

I think there was too much focus on the problems that came up while implementing





--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:



Good and clear explanation of the background, solution, and any problem (especially load balancing problem) the 

team encountered.  



* at least one thing to improve:



Think the graphs could use some work. Maybe use a logarithmic scale, instead of linear one for the y-axis?



--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:

	Nice use of diagrams, the moving one was super useful for understanding the

	problem space 



* at least one thing to improve:

	Formatting of testing info - a lot of numbers and parameters, could have been

	put in a table or something to make it easier to visually compare parameter values

Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:

> Diagrams, graphs and GIFs were helpful 



* at least one thing to improve:

> It was a bit hard to follow at times what approach you were talking about and where you were in your overall presentation flow





--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well: I really liked that this presentation put a

  strong focus on parallelization. The challenges and solutions were elaborated

  very well. There were also plenty of connections to materials we learned in

  this class. The presentation remained easy to follow despite the fact that

  you experimented with three different approaches. I think this is the only

  presentation I could follow from beginning to end, and that probably says

  more about your skills (and my attention span) than about the other groups.

  Well done!!



* at least one thing to improve: future work on Cuda implementation?






--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:

-I liked the topic of the presentation!  It seems like a nice problem that people have thought about for many years

-I was very impressed that you did three implementations

* at least one thing to improve:

-there was a bit of background noise that was very distracting and really interrupted the flow of the presentation

-it would be nice to know a little bit more about the application of the problem, how exactly can the prime numbers be used.



--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 





* at least one thing did well: they did a good job of explaining all of the implementations technically without getting into too much detail





* at least one thing to improve: maybe discuss some research done prior to project?



--------
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:



Great use of animations! I also liked the holistic approach to what we've

learned in the class, where you tried all sorts of different parallelization.



* at least one thing to improve:



I think that your presentation could have been improved by a little more

brevity. I also would have liked to see a discussion on further optimizations to

the sieve of Erastothenes from an algorithmic perspective.

=================================
Part B. Tia's Feedback
=================================
 
Talk feedback for Kevin, Mickey, Rick 



* at least one thing did well:


  * a very nice talk overall!

  * well organized and presented

  * clear/understandable intro with animation of the algorithm   

  * why shared memory nice

  * very nice explaination of the different parallel algs/approaches (good 

    overview, clear explaination, clear discussion of expectations and

    issues (and sometime solutions...like in openMP with dynamic/static)

  * nice results and explaination of results


* at least one thing to improve:

  * the animation once is nice, but on a loop over and over on subsequent

    slides, like on the OpenMP slide, was a bit distracting 

  * parallel approaches could be 2 slides each instead of just 1

    1: idea of parallelization expectations 2: issues and solutions
