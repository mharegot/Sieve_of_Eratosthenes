Final Report Project, CS87 Spring 2020

Overall:
--------
very nice project!  report is complete and very good.  

see my notes under 1. and under 2./3. about adding figures.  these
would be good for your presentation

Details:
-------
----------------
0. Does the abstract summarize the problem, the solution, and
   summarize experimental questions and results?
----------------

yes!

----------------
1. Does the paper introduce the key issues, the key ideas of
   the solution or breadth and depth of topic, the goals of the project, 
   discuss related work and use proper citation?
----------------

* very nice intro motivation, clearly stated problem and idea of soln.  
* add a figure of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to illustrate algorithm
  (I'm sure you could find on the web). This will help explain/illustrate the 
  idea of the algorithm at a higher level.
* briefly add the ideas of your three different methods in the last 
  paragraph of your introduction.
* related work is good.  A little more explaination of why in a few
  parts: why 4-5 nodes is a bottleneck.  why does broadcast avoid imballance?  
* state more explicitly what the imbalance in the parallel algorithm 
  is (is due to)

more minor comments:
* the sieve is solving a slightly different problem than you have talked about
  so far in your intro (it is finding all prime numbers between 1 and N vs. 
  checking if a number N is prime). It is worth adding a sentence to make 
  this clear. 
* after this sentence, "it can take significant work to discover whether or 
  not N is a prime number", add breifly why...something like an algorithm 
  has to check all values between 2 and sqrt(N) to determine if any are
  even divisors of N.   
* explain the complexity briefly (why it is O(nlnln) is not obvious).

----------------
2. Does the paper clearly present the parallel or distributed 
  solution or system?  Are figures effectively used to help describe this?
3. Is the system/solution/approach well explained.
----------------

* all methods (and variations) explained well, psuedo code good/helpful, 
  nice discussion of expectations of different parallelizations

* the cuda and pthreads are complicated enough that I think a figure
  illustrating the algorithms would be helpful to understanding
  (this would be nice to add in your talk)

* other approaches nice addition here
  * I suspect scaling to very large sizes, you would hit memory
    limits of a single node, and then a distributed approach would
    be beneficial (this is the point where on one machine partial
    results would have to be saved to a file to make space in memory
    for other portions of the problem).

more minor comments:
* don't use "we" when you are talking about steps of the algorithm (only
  when you refer to yourselves should you use "we").
* write in present-tense: "is" instead of "was", for example.
* you could parallelize the loop on line 2 too

--------------
4. Are the experiments clearly described, well designed, and the 
  results clearly presented?  Are the significance of the results discussed 
  and analyzed?  
----------------

yes. very nice. complete.

* experiements well designed
* say how many CPUs there were on the machine you ran experiements on
* nice results, explain a bit more in places though
* explain why you think smaller runs are slower than seq (if it is different
  for each approach, then say for each)
* in pthread, what do you think is reason for high speedup with 1?  this is 
  an odd result. 
* nice discussion of results!  Figure 5 is very nice.

more minor:

* in graph results: adding in another graph of just the end of x-axis results, 
  (and maybe in log scale) will help to see details at point where they 
  are interesting.
* did you add any timing of parts of cuda program to support any of your
  hypotheses of the why of its results?

----------------
5. Is there a complete conclusion?  Are future directions to this
  work presented/discussed?
----------------

yes.

----------------
6. Does the scope of the project and the completed components represent 
  a half semester worth of work?
----------------

yes.  definitely.  nice job on this!
